# REEES Digital Humanities and Open Access Resources 
 https://github.com/ian-nai/REEES-Digital-Humanities
This repository aims to host content and tools relevant to the digital humanities and REEES studies, especially as they may be used to further scholarship in area studies and distinctive collections within libraries and archives. This aims to address both institutional and public needs, breaking down barriers between the academic and the public by providing open source resources for free use by all.

The repository is currently divided into folders focusing on digital humanities tools and open access resources. More content will hopefully be added in the future, and I am open to any recommendations for additions.
