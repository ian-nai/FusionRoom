## Web Scraper / Cleaner
### https://github.com/ian-nai/WebScraperandCleaner
A Python script that lists all pages linked from a web address, scrapes an address specified by the user, exports that page as a text file, then removes script tags from the page and saves it as another text file. This provides an easy way to grab both the raw text and the full markup from webpages, making side-by-side comparison and text analysis simple and convenient.
